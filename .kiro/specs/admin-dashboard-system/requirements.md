# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a comprehensive administrative system for managing the entire banking application. It consists of two main components: a robust set of Admin APIs that provide full system administration capabilities, and a clean, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) dashboard that serves as the user interface. The dashboard will be containerized as a separate Docker image to ensure proper separation of concerns and independent deployment capabilities.
