# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a simple banking REST API service using Golang with the Gin web framework and SQLC for PostgreSQL database operations. The system will provide core banking functionality including account management, money transfers, and CRUD operations for banking entities. The service will support multiple accounts per user with different currencies and secure money transfer operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a bank customer, I want to create multiple accounts with different currencies, so that I can manage my finances in various currencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to create an account THEN the system SHALL create a new account with specified currency
2. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL assign a unique account ID and set initial balance to zero
3. WHEN a user requests to create multiple accounts THEN the system SHALL allow multiple accounts per user with different currencies
4. IF a user tries to create an account with invalid currency THEN the system SHALL return an error message
5. WHEN an account is created THEN the system SHALL store account details in PostgreSQL database
6. IF a user tries to create two accounts with same currency THEN the system SHALL return an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a bank customer, I want to view my account details and balance, so that I can monitor my financial status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests account details THEN the system SHALL return account ID, balance, currency, and creation date
2. WHEN a user requests to list all their accounts THEN the system SHALL return all accounts belonging to that user
3. IF a user requests details for a non-existent account THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
4. WHEN retrieving account information THEN the system SHALL ensure users can only access their own accounts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a bank customer, I want to transfer money between accounts, so that I can move funds as needed, the transfer operation happens in database transcation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a transfer THEN the system SHALL verify sufficient balance in source account
2. WHEN a transfer is valid THEN the system SHALL execute the entire transfer operation within a database transaction
3. WHEN a transfer occurs THEN the system SHALL deduct amount from source account and add to destination account atomically
4. WHEN a transfer occurs THEN the system SHALL record the transaction with timestamp and details
5. IF any part of the transfer fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the entire database transaction
6. IF source and destination accounts have different currencies THEN the system SHALL reject the transfer
7. IF insufficient balance exists THEN the system SHALL return an error and not process the transfer
8. WHEN a transfer is completed THEN the system SHALL return transaction confirmation details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a bank administrator, I want to perform CRUD operations on accounts, so that I can manage the banking system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates an account THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
2. WHEN an administrator updates account details THEN the system SHALL modify only allowed fields (not balance directly)
3. WHEN an administrator deletes an account THEN the system SHALL ensure account has zero balance
4. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL log all administrative actions
5. IF an account has transactions THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and return appropriate error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the API to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive clear feedback about issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid request is made THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages without exposing internal details
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 unauthorized status
5. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 too many requests status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to follow REST conventions, so that it's intuitive and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing endpoints THEN the system SHALL use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. WHEN structuring URLs THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful resource naming conventions
3. WHEN returning data THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON response formats
4. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL include appropriate HTTP headers
5. WHEN documenting APIs THEN the system SHALL provide clear endpoint specifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to use the latest stable versions of dependencies, so that security and performance are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable version of Gin web framework
2. WHEN configuring database access THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable version of SQLC
3. WHEN setting up PostgreSQL driver THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable version of pq or pgx driver
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use Go modules with latest compatible versions
5. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL target a recent stable Go version

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for the banking service, so that I can access banking functionality and manage my accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a new user record with unique identifier
2. WHEN creating a user THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (username, email, password)
3. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL hash and store the password securely
4. IF a user tries to register with existing username or email THEN the system SHALL return an error
5. WHEN user creation is successful THEN the system SHALL return user details without password
6. WHEN user registration occurs THEN the system SHALL execute user creation and welcome email queuing within a single database transaction
7. IF any part of the registration process fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the entire transaction

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to receive a welcome email when my account is successfully created, so that I feel welcomed and informed about the banking service, and I want to ensure that if user creation fails, no welcome email is sent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL execute user creation and welcome email queuing within a single database transaction
2. WHEN user creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL queue a welcome email task within the same transaction
3. IF user creation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the entire transaction and NOT queue any welcome email
4. IF welcome email queuing fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the user creation and return an error
5. WHEN queuing email tasks THEN the system SHALL use Redis as the message broker
6. WHEN processing email tasks THEN the system SHALL use Asyncq Golang package for background job processing
7. WHEN sending welcome emails THEN the system SHALL include user-specific information and service overview
8. IF email sending fails THEN the system SHALL retry the task according to configured retry policy
9. WHEN email is successfully sent THEN the system SHALL mark the user as having received welcome email

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to have proper version control and security practices, so that sensitive information is protected and code changes are tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the project THEN the system SHALL create a Git repository
2. WHEN setting up version control THEN the system SHALL create a .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files
3. WHEN handling configuration THEN the system SHALL exclude database passwords, API keys, and access tokens from version control
4. WHEN storing environment variables THEN the system SHALL use .env files that are excluded from Git
5. WHEN documenting the project THEN the system SHALL include setup instructions for environment configuration
