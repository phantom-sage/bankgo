# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow that automates Docker image building, testing, and deployment. The workflow will trigger on pushes to the main branch and pull requests, and will build and tag Docker images appropriately based on the trigger event. For version tags (v*.*.*), it will create tagged Docker images for release deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and test the application when I push code to the main branch, so that I can ensure code quality before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a push is made to the main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL build the Go application
3. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL run all unit tests
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL run integration tests if available
5. WHEN all tests complete THEN the system SHALL report the build status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to validate pull requests before they are merged, so that I can maintain code quality and prevent broken code from entering the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is opened or updated THEN the system SHALL trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. WHEN the workflow runs on a PR THEN the system SHALL build the Go application
3. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL run all unit tests
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL run integration tests if available
5. WHEN all tests complete THEN the system SHALL report the status back to the pull request
6. WHEN a pull request is merged or closed THEN the system SHALL automatically delete the feature branch

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to automatically create tagged Docker images when version tags are pushed, so that I can deploy specific versions to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a git tag matching the pattern "v*.*.*" (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.1.3) is pushed THEN the system SHALL trigger the release workflow
2. WHEN the release workflow runs THEN the system SHALL extract the version number from the tag
3. WHEN the version is extracted THEN the system SHALL build the Go application
4. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL run all tests
5. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build a Docker image
6. WHEN the Docker image is built THEN the system SHALL tag it with the version number
7. WHEN the image is tagged THEN the system SHALL push it to Docker Hub (docker.io) as a private image with the version tag

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workflow to include proper security scanning and quality checks, so that I can ensure the deployed applications are secure and follow best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker image is built (during version tag workflow) THEN the system SHALL scan it for security vulnerabilities using Trivy
2. WHEN Trivy scanning completes THEN the system SHALL scan both the base image and the final application image
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL report them in the workflow output with severity levels
4. WHEN the Go code is built THEN the system SHALL run static analysis tools
5. WHEN static analysis completes THEN the system SHALL report code quality metrics
6. IF critical or high severity vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL fail the workflow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the workflow to securely authenticate with Docker Hub and push images as private repositories, so that I can control access to the application images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow needs to push Docker images THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Docker Hub using stored credentials
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL use GitHub Secrets for Docker Hub username and password
3. WHEN pushing images THEN the system SHALL ensure they are pushed to a private repository on Docker Hub
4. WHEN the push completes THEN the system SHALL verify the image was successfully uploaded
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL fail the workflow with a clear error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the workflow to provide clear feedback and notifications, so that I can quickly understand the status of builds and deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow starts THEN the system SHALL update the commit status to "pending"
2. WHEN the workflow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the commit status to "success"
3. WHEN the workflow fails THEN the system SHALL update the commit status to "failure" with error details
4. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logs
5. WHEN a release is created THEN the system SHALL create a GitHub release with the built artifacts
