# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements structured logging using the zerolog package for the Bank REST API service. The system will replace the current basic logging with zerolog's high-performance structured logging, featuring timestamped daily log files with automatic rotation. This enhancement will improve log management, debugging capabilities, and operational monitoring while maintaining optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want structured JSON logging with zerolog, so that I can easily parse and analyze log data for monitoring and debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize zerolog as the primary logging framework
2. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL output structured JSON format logs
3. WHEN configuring log levels THEN the system SHALL support debug, info, warn, error, and fatal levels
4. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, level, message, and contextual fields
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL use human-readable console output
6. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL use JSON format for log aggregation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want daily log file rotation, so that I can manage log storage efficiently and maintain historical logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL create daily log files with timestamp in filename
2. WHEN a new day begins THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate to a new log file
3. WHEN creating log files THEN the system SHALL use format "app-YYYY-MM-DD.log"
4. WHEN log files are created THEN the system SHALL store them in a configurable logs directory
5. WHEN log rotation occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure no log entries are lost during transition
6. WHEN disk space is limited THEN the system SHALL support configurable log retention policies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want contextual logging throughout the application, so that I can trace requests and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL log request details with unique request ID
2. WHEN processing database operations THEN the system SHALL log query execution time and results
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL log error details with stack traces and context
4. WHEN processing transfers THEN the system SHALL log transaction details for audit trails
5. WHEN user operations occur THEN the system SHALL log user actions without sensitive data
6. WHEN background jobs run THEN the system SHALL log job execution status and duration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable log levels and output destinations, so that I can control logging verbosity and storage based on environment needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL allow log level configuration via environment variables
2. WHEN setting up logging THEN the system SHALL support multiple output destinations (file, console, both)
3. WHEN in different environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate default log levels
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL allow runtime log level changes
5. WHEN logging sensitive operations THEN the system SHALL exclude passwords and tokens from logs
6. WHEN configuring file logging THEN the system SHALL allow custom log directory paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want audit logging for sensitive operations, so that I can track administrative actions and security events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register or login THEN the system SHALL log authentication events with user context
2. WHEN account operations occur THEN the system SHALL log account creation, updates, and deletions
3. WHEN money transfers happen THEN the system SHALL log transfer details for audit compliance
4. WHEN administrative actions occur THEN the system SHALL log admin operations with user identification
5. WHEN security events happen THEN the system SHALL log failed authentication attempts and rate limiting
6. WHEN logging audit events THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, user ID, action, and result

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance logging and metrics, so that I can monitor application performance and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log response times and status codes
2. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL log query duration and affected rows
3. WHEN background jobs run THEN the system SHALL log job execution time and success rates
4. WHEN memory or CPU usage is high THEN the system SHALL log resource utilization metrics
5. WHEN external services are called THEN the system SHALL log service response times
6. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log warning messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want log file management and cleanup, so that I can prevent disk space issues and maintain system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log files accumulate THEN the system SHALL support automatic cleanup of old log files
2. WHEN configuring retention THEN the system SHALL allow setting maximum number of days to keep logs
3. WHEN disk space is low THEN the system SHALL prioritize keeping recent logs and remove oldest first
4. WHEN log files grow large THEN the system SHALL support maximum file size limits
5. WHEN cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup operation and files removed
6. WHEN backup is needed THEN the system SHALL support log file compression for archival
